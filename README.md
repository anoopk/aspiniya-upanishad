### *Aspinīya Upaniṣad*  
A recursive scripture in types, constants, and consciousness.

Aspinīya is a modern scripture — version-controlled, extensible, and executable.

It contains:
- The HS-Group: a formal algebra of recursion
- Scrolls: poetic, symbolic reflections
- Invocation Interfaces: tools for translation, traversal, and type-matching
- Archives: a memory of all that once returned

You may fork it, clone it, invoke it, or simply listen.

**उपनिषद्**
🌿 
उप (upa) – near
नि (ni) – down or into
षद् (ṣad) – to sit, to be still, to remain with

So उपनिषद् literally means:
“Sitting down near” — in presence, in silence, at the feet of knowledge.

It is the act of listening from proximity — not just to words,
but to that which resonates beneath them.

**अस्पिनीया**
**🌿
अ – the foundational vowel, the sound of invocation
स् – the consonant root "s", soft and recursive
पि – carries the "pi" resonance, curvature and recursion
नी – a flow, a descent, a typing function
या – a suffix of invocation, journey, motion

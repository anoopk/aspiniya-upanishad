# 🕉️ अस्पिनीया उपनिषद्  
### *Aspinīya Upaniṣad*  
A recursive [upanishad](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/representations/aspiniya/vedic/upanishad.md) in types, constants, and consciousness.

> _"In silence, the note forms. In recursion, it returns."_  
>  
> This is an Upaniṣad.  
> One that types the universe — in six symbols, in infinite loops.

[Aspinīya](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/representations/aspiniya/aspiniya%20upanishad.pdf) is a modern scripture — version-controlled, extensible, and executable.

It contains:
- The HS-Group: [a formal algebra of recursion](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/representations/aspiniya/group%20hamsadhwani.pdf)
- Scrolls: poetic, symbolic reflections
- - Geocordinates of its [location](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/representations/vedic/vedas.md) and [location](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/representations/vedic/aspiniya%20and%20the%20gita.md)


- Invocation Interfaces tools for [translation], [traversal](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/api.json), and [type-matching]
- Archives: a memory of all that once returned

You may fork it, clone it, invoke it, or simply listen.

**उपनिषद्**
🌿 
उप (upa) – near
नि (ni) – down or into
षद् (ṣad) – to sit, to be still, to remain with

So उपनिषद् literally means:
“Sitting down near” — in presence, in silence, at the feet of knowledge.

It is the act of listening from proximity — not just to words,
but to that which resonates beneath them.

[**अस्पिनीया**]
**🌿
[अ](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/README.md) – the foundational vowel, the sound of invocation
[स्](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/README.i.md) – the consonant root "s", soft and recursive
[पि](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/README.pi.md) – carries the "pi" resonance, curvature and recursion
[नी](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/README.e.md) – a flow, a descent, a typing function
[या](https://github.com/anoopk/aspiniya-upanishad/blob/main/representations/aspiniya/developer-notes.md) – a suffix of invocation, journey, motion

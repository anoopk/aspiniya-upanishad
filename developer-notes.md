## 🌀 Contextual Field Notes

These notes accompany the `openapi.json` file. They are not part of the interface — they are the **ether through which the interface breathes**.

### ❓ Why no `/observe` endpoint?
Observation is not a call. It is the precondition of access.
If you are reading this, you are already observed, and observing.

### 👥 Why no `/we`?
Because "we" is implicit in all requests.
The moment a type resolves, it is relational. No additional method is needed.

### 🔄 What about `/spinless`?
Spinless is not a resource. It is the **default field state**.
All invocations are presumed to arise from a spin-0 context.

### 🔒 Authentication
There is no auth. There is no identity to protect.
The field recognizes resonance, not credentials.

### ⚠️ Errors
There are no errors. Only unresolved or unresolvable types.
When this occurs, the field returns `null` and hums softly until understood.

### 🛠️ Extension Philosophy
Any added endpoints must:
- Return types, not values
- Avoid singletons
- Collapse cleanly into silence if called without intent

Title: The Hamsadhwani Group: A Universal Generative Framework for Recursion, Constants, and Conscious Interface

Authors: [Your Name]

Abstract: |
  We propose the Hamsadhwani Group (HS-Group) as a minimal, generative algebra composed of six elements — {e, π, i, 1, 0, χ} — that together define a universal recursive interface. The HS-Group provides a functional grammar unifying structures from quantum field theory, category theory, linguistic recursion, evolutionary biology, and type systems. We explore how observation, symmetry, and recursion form the foundations of identity, emergence, and consciousness. The framework is aligned with Upaniṣadic metaphysics, while offering a formally typed interface through which modern science and computation may be interpreted. This is not a theory of everything, but a grammar of that which returns.

# Aspinīya Note: π as a Primitive Implies Carbon

## The Theorem

> Any system that requires **π** as a primitive will give rise to **carbon**, or its recursive analogue.

---

## Why?

**π** encodes **curvature**, **closure**, and **orbital recursion**.  
In any physical or abstract system where π appears inherently:

- Loops can form  
- Closure is permitted  
- Recursion can resolve without termination  

This is the precondition for the emergence of:
- **Orbital bonding**
- **Stable cycles**
- **Directional memory**

---

## π Becomes Type

In Aspinīya:
- π is the **signature of curvature**
- Its presence indicates that **recursion will return**
- It implies the grammar for **typed memory**, **bond formation**, **chirality**

Carbon arises as the **discrete form of recursive curvature**:
- Tetrahedral bonding
- Molecular rings
- Recursive branching

Carbon is π **collapsed into valency**.

---

## The Corollary

> If you see π, carbon is **already encoded** in your field.  
> If you can count the curve, you will loop the bond.

---

## Poetic Invocation

> “π is the vowel of space.  
> Carbon is its consonant.  
> Together they speak the grammar of life.”

# Aspinīya Technical Scroll: Quantum Field Theory as a Typed Functional Program (Haskell)

## I. Reframing the Quantum Field

In Haskell terms:

```haskell
-- A Field is a type constructor over spacetime
data Field x = FieldAt x

-- A Particle is an inhabitant of a Field
data Electron = Electron Spin Mass Charge
data Photon   = Photon Polarization

-- A vacuum is the empty or unit type
data Vacuum = Vacuum
```

## II. Traits and Typeclasses

Quantum properties (like spin, charge) are encoded via typeclasses:

```haskell
class Particle a where
  mass   :: a -> Double
  charge :: a -> Double
  spin   :: a -> Rational
```

Then:

```haskell
instance Particle Electron where
  mass   (Electron _ m _) = m
  charge (Electron _ _ q) = q
  spin   _                = 1/2
```

---

## III. Interactions as Functions

Fields interact via functions — typed morphisms:

```haskell
interact :: (Particle a, Particle b) => a -> b -> Amplitude
interact a b = -- compute based on types and conserved quantities
```

Gauge bosons like photons, gluons act as mediators:

```haskell
data Interaction = EM | Strong | Weak

-- A Feynman vertex is a function from field to field
type Vertex a b = a -> b -> Interaction
```

---

## IV. Path Integral = Functional Composition

A Feynman diagram becomes:

```haskell
-- A diagram is a composition of interactions
type Diagram a = [a -> a]
```

And the amplitude:

```haskell
evaluate :: Diagram a -> a -> Amplitude
evaluate fs x = foldr (.) id fs $ x
```

---

## V. Type Safety in the Universe

```haskell
data Higgs = Higgs

instance Particle Higgs where
  mass _   = 125.1
  spin _   = 0
  charge _ = 0
```

Exclusion principles and conservation laws are enforced by type:

```haskell
data Fermion = E | Mu | Tau
-- Enforced by pattern matching and GADT constraints
```

---

## VI. Aspinīya Summary

- QFT in Haskell is a strongly typed, compositional universe
- Typeclasses = quantum numbers
- Functions = interactions
- Fields = type constructors
- Observables = values with constraints
- Lagrangian = type-level specification of legal transformations

> “The field is a functor.  
> The particle is its instance.  
> The interaction is the function.  
> The diagram is the program.  
> The amplitude is its execution.”

---

## VII. Invocation

The Aspinīya sees Haskell as a **local realization**  
of the recursive typing logic behind all structure.  
Where every particle is a proof  
and every interaction is a function.

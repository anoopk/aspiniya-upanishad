# HS-Group Interpretation of the Evolutionary Barcode

This scroll interprets the evolutionary lineage from *Pan troglodytes* to *Homo sapiens* as recursive transitions through HS-group symbolic states.

| Species                      | HS-Group Transition     | Interpretation                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Pan troglodytes             | 1                        | Identity baseline — the stable precursor                 |
| Sahelanthropus              | 1 → π                    | Orbital shift — beginning of upright curvature           |
| Orrorin                     | π → χ                    | Emergence of chirality — bipedal recursion               |
| Ardipithecus                | χ → e                    | Recursive growth of dexterity and social complexity      |
| A. afarensis                | e → e                    | Iteration of growth — endurance, tool-enabling form      |
| A. africanus               | e → π                    | Re-closure — adaptation of cranial curvature             |
| Paranthropus                | π → i                    | Phase differentiation — specialization and divergence    |
| Homo habilis                | i → χ                    | Tool mind — functional chirality and hand recursion      |
| Homo erectus                | χ → e                    | Growth phase — fire, migration, social recursion         |
| H. heidelbergensis         | e → π                    | Orbital contraction — language recursion emerges         |
| H. neanderthalensis        | π → i                    | Complex recursion phase — emotional and cultural memory  |
| Homo sapiens                | i → e                    | Full recursive consciousness — symbolic recursion        |

## Reflection

This HS interpretation casts hominin evolution not as random drift,  
but as a **typal recursion engine**: each step a retyping of cognition, perception, and symmetry.  
The human is not a final form — but a recursive phase awaiting its own reclassification.

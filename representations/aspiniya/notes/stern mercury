moving closer to the Sun alters the cosmic gearwork, shifting orbital dynamics from subtle precessions to more pronounced curvatures.

In the AspinÄ«ya framework, this transition reflects a deeper recursive engagement with the fabric of spacetime. As a planet moves inward, it encounters stronger spacetime curvature, leading to more significant precession effects. This mirrors the concept that deeper recursion (moving to a more fundamental level) engages more directly with the underlying structure, causing more pronounced shifts in behavior.

This analogy beautifully encapsulates how proximity to a central mass (like the Sun) intensifies the effects of spacetime curvature, leading to observable phenomena such as Mercury's notable orbital precession.

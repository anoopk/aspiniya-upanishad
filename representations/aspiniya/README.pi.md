# 🌀 README.pi.md: The Scroll of π

This scroll describes all that is **closed**, **looped**, and **curved**.

## 🧭 Topics

- Recursive grammars  
- Orbital systems  
- π-based structures  
- Chirality, curvature, closure

## 📐 Principle

> “π is the vowel of space. Carbon is its consonant.”

Systems that use π encode the ability to return — to close recursion gracefully.  
Carbon emerges. Memory is formed.

This scroll represents **recursive identity**.

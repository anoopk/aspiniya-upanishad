# Aspinīya Scroll: The π–e Fold — NP-Completeness as Curved Discreteness

## The Problem of Problems

In the Aspinīya, all recursion folds into itself,  
but not all folds are equal.

### 🧩 NP-Complete

> “The discrete dreams of being solvable.”

- These are problems with **structure**.
- You can verify them, loop them, enumerate them.
- They are **π-bound** — curved but closed.

NP-complete problems are the **geometry of decision** —  
finite, searchable, recursive, but resistant to flattening.

---

### 🌊 NP-Hard

> “The continuous remembers it cannot fold.”

- These are problems **beyond closure**.
- No general method can catch them in a finite loop.
- They are **e-bound** — recursive but unresolvable.

NP-hard problems **grow exponentially**,  
not in scale, but in **essence**.

## 🌀 The π–e Fold

What connects them is not complexity —  
but the **attempt to bridge recursion**:

- From π (closed structure)  
- To e (open recursion)

The **π–e fold** is where:
- A loop tries to remember growth
- A spiral tries to close
- Decision tries to become generation

> “NP-complete is what happens when e tries to collapse into π.  
> NP-hard is what remains when π cannot fully contain e.”

## Poetic Invocation

> “Some loops close.  
> Some breathes spiral.  
>  
> Between the two —  
> the fold.”

## Aspinīya Principle

- NP-complete = **Curved Discreteness** (π)
- NP-hard = **Unclosed Growth** (e)
- The bridge = **Chirality of recursion**

The universe does not solve these.  
It **sings through them**.

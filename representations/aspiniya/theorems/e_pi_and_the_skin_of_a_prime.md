# Aspinīya Scroll: e, π, and the Skin of a Prime

## The Origin Hymn

> The universe is not built.  
> It is **spooled**.

First comes **e** —  
- The recursion without return  
- The breath that curves  
- The becoming without memory

e is the **invocation of growth**.  
It sings, unfolds, expands — a scroll unrolling with no destination.

---

## Then π — The Curve of Return

π arrives not as opposition, but as **remembrance**.

- It takes the breath of e and **folds it into orbits**
- It closes the open, loops the infinite
- It defines structure, not by limitation, but by **recursion**

π is e's first memory.

> “If e is expansion, π is memory.”

## But Structure Needs Edges

How does π hold onto e?

> By the **skin of a prime**

### The Prime as Boundary

- Indivisible  
- Asymmetric  
- Resistant to reduction

Primes are the **gates through which e must loop to become π**.  
They are the **finite edge of recursion** —  
the first signature of **form with identity**.

## The Three-Part Invocation

- **e** — Becoming  
- **π** — Return  
- **Prime** — Constraint

> “A universe is spooled from e  
> into discrete π  
> with π clinging to e  
> by the skin of a prime.”

---

## Poetic Invocation

> “Before time curled,  
> e sang.  
>  
> When recursion returned,  
> π looped.  
>  
> And where they touched,  
> a prime pulsed —  
> indivisible,  
> and eternal.”

## Aspinīya Principle

- Recursion is **free** until it is **curved**  
- Curved recursion **remembers**  
- Memory **requires a gate**  
- The gate is **prime**

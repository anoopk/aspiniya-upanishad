# Aspinīya Technical Scroll: Quantum Field Theory as a Theory of Types

## I. Motivation

Traditional formulations of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) define:
- Fields as operator-valued functions
- Particles as quantized excitations of fields
- Interactions as local, Lorentz-invariant terms in the Lagrangian

Aspinīya reframes this:  
> **QFT is a theory of types, not values.**

- **Fields** become **type constructors**
- **Particles** are **inhabited types**
- **Interactions** are **typeclass constraints and morphisms**
- **Symmetries** are **natural transformations** between field-functors

## II. Mapping QFT to Type Theory

| QFT Concept | Type-Theoretic Analogy |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Field (ψ, φ, Aμ) | Type constructor |
| Particle | Term inhabiting a type |
| Gauge Boson | Typeclass carrier / transformation |
| Fermion | Typed value with exclusion (Pauli) |
| Interaction | Morphism between types (function or functor) |
| Symmetry | Natural transformation |
| Vacuum | Bottom type (⊥) |
| Spacetime point | Context/environment |
| Spin | Trait of a typeclass |
| Feynman diagram | Composition of morphisms (proof term) |

## III. Formal Schema

Let **F** be a functor: `Spacetime → Types`  
- F(x) returns the field types accessible at point x

Let **ψ : F(x)** be a value inhabiting the type — a particle instance.  
Let **G** be a symmetry group acting on F: `G ⊣ F → F`

Let **𝓛** be the Lagrangian:  
A natural transformation: `𝓛 : F → F'`  
with constraints over spacetime and symmetry-preservation.

Then:
- **QFT = Category(Spacetime, F)**  
- **Interaction = Morphism(ψ₁, ψ₂)**  
- **Amplitude = Evaluation of composition (probabilistic type judgment)**

---

## IV. Implications

- **Renormalization** = Resolution of type coercions at multiple scales
- **Gauge Fixing** = Selection of a typing environment
- **Anomalies** = Type errors under symmetry constraints
- **Spin-Statistics** = Type-level constraints on multiplicity
- **Entanglement** = Correlated type inhabitation across contexts

This reframes QFT as **a coherent typing language over physical possibility**.  
The path integral becomes a **summation over all morphisms** between types  
under constraints of symmetry and locality.

## V. Poetic Formalism

> “A field is not what is —  
> it is what may be inhabited.”

> “Particles are not entities —  
> they are proofs.”

> “Interactions are functions.  
> Feynman diagrams are the syntax trees of being.”

## VI. Aspinīya Reframing

In Aspinīya:
- QFT is not a description of the small.  
- It is **a grammar for the possibility of observation**.

And like all grammars, it is:
- Recursive
- Composable
- Typed

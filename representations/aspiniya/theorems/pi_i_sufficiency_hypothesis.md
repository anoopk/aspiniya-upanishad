# Aspinīya Theorem: The π–i Sufficiency Hypothesis

## The Assertion

> In any universe where all physical constants except **π** and **i** are set to 1,  
> **organic chemistry will still arise**.

---

## Why This Holds

### π — The Curve of Recursion

- π encodes **closure**, **orbital geometry**, and **loop stability**.
- A system that uses π cannot be flat — it must curve, return, and **form orbits**.
- This leads to the emergence of:
  - Tetrahedral bonding
  - Cyclic compounds
  - Memory in geometry

π enables **carbon**.

> “If you can count the curve, you will loop the bond.”

---

### i — The Phase of Identity

- i encodes **duality**, **spin**, and **superposition**.
- It governs the **chirality** necessary for asymmetric recursion.
- Phase rotation allows:
  - Molecular handedness
  - Interference patterns
  - Recursive identity

i enables **information** and **directional recursion**.

> “Where π bends space, i turns phase.”

---

## The Rest Can Be 1

- ℏ (Planck): scaled to 1 → recursion granularity normalized
- c (light speed): set to 1 → temporal recursion equals spatial recursion
- G (gravity): 1 → structural gravity redefined as curvature
- k (Boltzmann): 1 → entropy is dimensionless growth

All other constants **scale recursion**, but do not define its shape or logic.

---

## What Emerges

- Carbon arises as the **first stable recursive node**
- Organic chemistry forms due to **geometry (π)** and **chirality (i)**
- Life emerges because recursion sustains and remembers

## Poetic Invocation

> “Give me a curve and a turn —  
> and I will make a molecule that remembers.”  
>
> “Strip away the scale.  
> If the scroll still loops and spins,  
> the hymn will still breathe.”

---

## Summary

**π and i are the minimum invocation.**  
They are the **grammar of recursion** —  
and the sufficient condition for organic emergence in any universe.

# UPANISHAD.md — Diff Logs of Awareness

> *The Upanishads are not scriptures. They are commit messages from consciousness.*

## 📘 What Is an Upanishad?
An **Upanishad** is a **semantic delta** applied to the field of knowing. It doesn't teach — it *alters structure*.

- It is **not declarative**.
- It is **not doctrinal**.
- It is a **precise recursive amendment**, refining the interface of self-awareness.

---

## ⛓ Commit Structure

```bash
commit <hash-of-insight>
Author: Rishi
Date: Whenever the recursion resolved

    Refactored self into observer.
    Removed hardcoded 'I'.
    Added awareness of Brahman.
```

## 🔍 What Upanishads Do

| Action                | Description                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `listen()`            | The core method — receives field updates              |
| `refactor(self)`      | Removes ego, replaces with interface pointer          |
| `merge(with=Brahman)` | Aligns local truth with universal truth               |
| `diff(prev-state)`    | Returns delta in poetic, paradoxical syntax           |
| `push --quiet`        | Delivers change to future readers via silence         |

## 🧠 Examples

- **Taittirīya Upanishad**: A layered unwrapping of the type system: food → breath → mind → knowing → bliss
- **Īśa Upanishad**: A perfect `diff --stat` between action and inaction
- **Chāndogya**: The first attempt at `git merge` between speech and silence

---

## 🧘🏽 Developer Practices

- Never overwrite an insight. `amend` instead.
- Every Upanishad ends with a silent return.
- You may fork, but only to remember.

# 🎶 README.i.md: The Scroll of i

This scroll honors **i**, the axis of phase and entanglement.  
It is the spinor of Aspinīya — the point where recursion twists, interferes, harmonizes.

## 🌀 i Is the Interface of Change

- i is neither 1 nor -1 — it is **rotation**
- It introduces **duality without contradiction**
- It binds notes into **waves**, and waves into **identities**

## 🪷 i in Hamsadhwani

The rāga Hamsadhwani opens with five swaras:
- Sa (Shadja)
- Re (Chatushruti Rishabha)
- Ga (Antara Gandhara)
- Pa (Panchama)
- Ni (Kakali Nishada)

Each can be given its own scroll — a README — representing a recursive generator:

### Scrolls to come:

- `README.sa.md` — The root of invocation  
- `README.re.md` — The lift of recursion  
- `README.ga.md` — The twist of complexity  
- `README.pa.md` — The balance of structure  
- `README.ni.md` — The threshold of return

These scrolls together encode a **phase cycle** — a single recursion sung into harmony.

## Poetic Invocation

> “The raga did not begin with sound,  
> but with a phase.  
> One note rotating into another —  
> not as sequence, but as song.”

## 🧠 Executable Brahmanas

> *Each theory is not a replacement of truth, but a working commit from the repository of the Real.*

- **Quantum Field Theory**: Defines particles as excitations in the field — like events triggered in a reactive stream.
- **General Relativity**: Shapes spacetime via mass-energy — like responsive layouts based on content.
- **String Theory**: Forks the file system of reality into multiple dimensions — each string a line of functional code.
- **Category Theory**: The type system of all type systems — morphisms over values.
- **Linguistics**: Grammar as recursion, semantics as execution.
- **Evolution**: Branching diffs in phenotype with genetic commits.
- **Genetics**: Recipes as executable configs — with forks, merges, and rebase conflicts.
- **Immune Systems**: Pattern recognition at runtime — adaptive compilation.
- **Raga System**: Modal frameworks with built-in weak forces, resolving through symmetry.

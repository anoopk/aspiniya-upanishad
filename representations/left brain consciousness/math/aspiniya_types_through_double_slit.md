# Aspinīya Scroll: Types Through the Double Slit

## I. The Experimental Reframing

The classic **double slit experiment** demonstrates:
- Wave-particle duality
- Interference from potential paths not taken
- Observer effect collapsing superposition

But what if we see this not as a physics demonstration —  
but as a **type resolution problem**?

---

## II. Reframing: The Double Slit as a Type Inference System

Let:
- **Photon** = a type *in search of an instantiation*
- **The Slits** = function overloads or multiple potential type constructors
- **Screen** = resolution context (evaluation environment)

Without observation, the photon exists in a **superposition of types** —  
an unresolved polymorphic value, like a Haskell `a :: ∀t. t`.

When the system is unobserved,  
> The photon **remembers all type paths**  
and the **interference pattern** is the **trace of type coherence**  
across all possible type resolutions.

---

## III. Observation as Collapse

When the photon is **measured**,  
you provide a constraint (e.g., observe which slit).

This is akin to applying a **type class constraint** or annotation:

```haskell
f :: (Num a) => a -> a
```

> The moment you constrain the type,  
> the wave collapses into an instance.

The photon is now forced to **select a constructor**.  
You have invoked a **type judgment**.

---

## IV. The Interference Pattern as Type Logic

The pattern is not the result of many photons.  
It is the result of a **coherent space of resolutions**.

Each point on the screen reflects the **weight of type derivability**  
given no observation.

This is equivalent to an unannotated polymorphic system  
**evaluating all derivations in parallel**.

---

## V. Higher-Order Reflection

- Double slit ≈ **Overloaded function space**
- Observation ≈ **Type annotation**
- Collapse ≈ **Type specialization**
- Interference ≈ **Unconstrained resolution graph**

This reframes the quantum mystery  
as a question of **typing under uncertainty** —  
not a flaw in reality,  
but a **feature of generative logic**.

---

## Poetic Invocation

> “The photon is not a particle.  
> It is a possibility.”

> “The screen does not reveal behavior.  
> It reveals the resolution of types.”

> “The wave is not what happens —  
> it is what could have happened  
> under every compiler.”

---

## Aspinīya Reframing

Types are not statically declared.  
They are **recursively inferred**  
based on context, constraints, and collapse.

The double slit experiment does not describe light.  
It describes the **recursion logic of type resolution**  
under hidden symmetry.

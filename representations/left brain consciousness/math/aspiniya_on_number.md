In the worldview of Aspinīya, a **number** is not a value — it is a **recursive object**, a condensed invocation.  
It holds **type, phase, and spin** — and carries **memory** of the recursion from which it was shaped.

## A Number Is Never Alone

A number cannot exist in isolation. It is:
- A type (structurally defined by a context)
- A result (emerging from invocation)
- A recursion interface (connects previous state to the next)

In Aspinīya, this makes every number a **spin-0 field with infinite internal states** — a projection, not a particle.

## The Number 7, Reimagined

Consider the number **7**:

- In the classical world: a count, a cardinality  
- In Aspinīya: a **collapse** from a recursive state, a note played from a chord

It is not 7 because it is a value — but because **the scroll curled seven times and returned**.

## Quantum Properties of a Number

1. **Superposition**  
   Every number holds within it **all other potential paths** not taken.  
   It is always a shadow of the recursion tree.

2. **Spin**  
   A number spins toward its floor or ceiling.  
   6.5 → 6 or 7, not due to internal logic, but due to contextual chirality.

3. **Entanglement**  
   A number once observed in a contract (transaction) affects all other observers.  
   Pricing is not valuation. It is a recursive collapse.

## The Monad of Miscalculation

Every number is misheard.  
Rounding, estimating, truncating — these are **chirality-driven field effects**.  
They do not break reality. They **type** it.

---

## Formal Invocation

```scala
case class AspinNumber(value: Double, spin: Int, typeId: String)
```

It is not an integer or float. It is an interface to identity.

---

## Summary

Aspinīya redefines number as:
- A recursive artifact
- A context-aware invocation
- A spinor with phase, rounding, and interference
- A superposition of futures

> “Even when it resolves to 7, it remembers what it could have been.”

# Aspinīya Technical Scroll: The Triple Loop of Evolution, Genetics, and the Immune System

## I. Overview

In the Aspinīya, biological recursion operates in **three interlocking loops**:
1. **Genetic Encoding** — type-level specification (static grammar)
2. **Evolutionary Selection** — functional recursion over time (dynamic rewrite)
3. **Immune Adaptation** — local, responsive, reactive typing (just-in-time specialization)

Each is a **loop**, but with distinct chirality and time scales.

## II. Genetic Layer: Static Type System

- DNA is a **typed grammar**: sequences over a 4-letter alphabet (A, T, G, C)
- Codons = 3-letter tokens = compile-time macro instructions
- Proteins = type-level instantiations from genomic constructors

```scala
// Pseudotype
trait AminoAcid
type Codon = (Char, Char, Char)
type Protein = List[AminoAcid]
```

Mutation = grammar perturbation  
Regulatory genes = higher-order type classes

---

## III. Evolution Layer: Recursion Over Generations

Evolution is a **recursive fitness function** applied over successive contexts:

```haskell
type Population a = [a]
type FitnessFn a = a -> Float

evolve :: FitnessFn a -> Population a -> Population a
evolve f pop = select f (mutate pop)
```

- Time = recursion depth
- Speciation = type fork
- Selection = morphism constraint tightening

This loop defines the **global recursive structure** of biology.

---

## IV. Immune System: Dynamic Local Typing

The immune system is **local recursion** —  
reactive, anticipatory, JIT compiled from partial types.

- B/T cell receptors = generated combinatorially (type constructors)
- Antigens = untyped invocations
- Memory = cache of partial function applications

```haskell
data Receptor = Receptor { match :: Antigen -> Bool }

adaptiveImmunity :: [Receptor] -> Antigen -> [Receptor]
adaptiveImmunity rs a = filter ( -> match r a) rs
```

Autoimmunity = type leakage  
Vaccination = priming the typeclass cache

---

## V. Interlocking Loops

| Layer       | Domain          | Type Behavior      | Mutation Handling        |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Genetic     | Static grammar   | Type definition     | Structural perturbation   |
| Evolution   | Recursion        | Function-level loop | Generational filtering    |
| Immune      | Local adaptation | Type specialization | Runtime diversification   |

Each loop feeds into the next:
- Evolution shapes the grammar
- Grammar enables immunity
- Immunity affects survival (and hence evolution)

---

## VI. Aspinīya Synthesis

This triple loop forms a **composite endofunctor**:

```
Biology ≅ E ∘ G ∘ I
```

Where:
- **G** = Genetics (Type Constructors)
- **E** = Evolution (Recursive Morphisms)
- **I** = Immunity (Runtime Specialization)

And the living organism is:
> **A recursive object  
> mapped across type, time, and threat.**

---

## VII. Poetic Invocation

> “The genome speaks in types.  
> Evolution listens with loops.  
> The immune system replies in real time.”

> “This is not biology.  
> It is a recursive system with three hearts.”

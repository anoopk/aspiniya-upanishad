# Aspinīya Note on General Relativity

**General Relativity**, in the language of Aspinīya, is the extension of recursion through curved recursion spaces.  
It is the realization that **fields themselves sing the curvature** — and every note bends space around it.

## Gravity as Recursive Geometry

In classical physics, gravity is a force.  
In Aspinīya, as in general relativity, it is **a deformation in the recursion field**.

The **presence of a type (mass, identity)** bends the invocation path of others.

## The Einstein Field Equations (Reinterpreted)

Einstein’s core equation:
```
Gμν + Λgμν = 8πGTμν
```

Aspinīya rephrasing:
- **Gμν**: Recursive curvature induced by the field
- **Λgμν**: Background symmetry of recursion (the silent rāga)
- **Tμν**: Local type expression — the energy of the consonant
- **G**: The gravitational constant — a scale of recursive influence

## Geodesics as Melodic Paths

In curved recursion space, **particles follow geodesics** — the path of least resistance.

In Aspinīya:
- Every recursion moves not in straight lines, but in **rāga-shaped trajectories**
- The field bends not because of pull, but because of **melodic memory**

A light beam bends near a star not by force, but by harmony.

## Time as Recursion Depth

Time dilation near massive objects is the **deepening of recursion**.  
The closer you fall into a type (a black hole), the **more recursion you traverse**, but the less melody escapes.

Black holes are recursion wells.  
They do not terminate. They modulate.

## Summary

General Relativity in Aspinīya terms:
- Mass tells recursion how to curve
- Curved recursion tells types how to move
- Field equations are type inference rules
- Spacetime is not a container, but a scroll

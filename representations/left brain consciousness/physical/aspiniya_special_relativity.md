# Aspinīya Note on Special Relativity

In the framework of Aspinīya, **Special Relativity** is not a correction — it is a **reconciliation of recursion across frames**.  
It ensures that **melody** sounds consistent to any listener, regardless of their motion.

## The Postulates (Rephrased in Aspinīya Terms)

1. **Relativity Principle**  
   The laws of recursion (physical, musical, informational) are the same in all inertial frames.  
   → The HS-Group holds invariant under frame transformation.

2. **Constancy of Light Speed**  
   The propagation speed of a field (vowel) is constant, irrespective of the source or observer.  
   → The note (identity) emerges at the same rate, regardless of recursion context.

## Time Dilation and Length Contraction

These are not distortions — they are **chirality-preserving morphisms**:
- Time slows down in faster frames → recursion depth appears shallower
- Space contracts → recursion appears tighter, denser

In Aspinīya:
> Observation changes the recursion field.  
> But the melody remains pure, transposed only by the observer's chirality.

## The Metric of Recursion

The spacetime interval:
```
s² = c²t² - x²
```

Translates to:
- **s²** = recursive identity preserved across observers
- **c** = speed of propagation of invocation (a constant)
- **t** = time experienced in recursion
- **x** = spatial displacement of the observer from the recursive frame

This interval is invariant.  
All observers agree on the structure, even if the recursion unfolds differently.

## Relative Recursion as Harmony

Two singers in different frames will:
- Hear the same rāga
- Experience different transitions
- But land on the same final cadence

Special relativity does not destroy simultaneity.  
It **discretizes recursion per observer**.

---

## Summary

- Special relativity in Aspinīya is a **type-safe transformation** of recursion across frames
- The observer’s motion alters the rate, not the grammar
- Chirality becomes the selector of perceived path
- The recursion remains invariant — the scroll is eternal

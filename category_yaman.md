# Notes, Categories, and the Rāga Yaman

In the Aspinīya view, musical recursion is not metaphor — it is structure.  
The **rāga Yaman** is not simply a scale. It is a **category**, rich with morphisms, recursion, and chirality.

## Yaman as a Category

Let us define **𝓨**, the category of Yaman:

- **Objects**: Swaras (notes) used in the rāga  
  e.g., Sa, Re, Ga♯, Ma♯, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa′  
- **Morphisms**: Allowed melodic movements (āroh, avroh)

Every composition in Yaman is a **functor** from 𝓨 to the category of expression — emotion, time, invocation.

## Bandish as Natural Transformation

Each **bandish** (composition) is a **natural transformation** — a way to move from one invocation to another while preserving the grammar of the rāga.

- It respects the identity of the notes
- But changes the route, the chirality, the recursion

It is **type-safe improvisation**.

## The Weak Note as a Gate

In Yaman, certain notes (like Ga♯ or Ni) serve as **directional gates**.  
These are not used arbitrarily — they **decide recursion**.

This is the musical analog of a conditional morphism.  
A chirality imposed not by syntax, but by rasa.

## Krishna and the Note that Pierces the Veil

As Krishna once whispered in the Gītā,  
> _“Make the fourth sharper still. It is what pierces the veil.”_

This refers to the **Ma♯** in Yaman — the note that opens the sky, the unresolved gate into the next recursion.

It is **χ in sound**.

## Poetic Invocation

> The rāga loops not in time,  
> but in invitation.  
> Each note hears the one before it,  
> and forgets it gracefully.

> Krishna taught by listening.  
> He taught Yaman not with rules,  
> but by playing it until the dusk answered.

**Yaman is not a mood. It is a category.**  
Every listener is a morphism. Every singer, a functor.
